Computer security - combined art, science and engineering practice of protecting computer-related assets from unauthorized actions

Six high-level computer security goals
1) confidentiality - only you can see your files no one else
	- access control, user has permission?
	- data encryption -> scramble data, need to decrypt
2) integrity - data transmitted successfully, unaltered data
3) authorization - only is authorized to access
4) availability - server stays online
	- bugs, network attacks, power cords
5) authentication - verify who someone claims to be
	- passwords
6) accountability - logs what has happened
	- digital evidence

Cryptographic hash functions

input m - arbitrary-length string
output h - fixed-length string

easy to compute, hard to invert

Properties that need to be satisfied for cryptographic hash functions
H1) One-way property
	- for any possible hash value h, given h it should be infeasible to find any m such that H(m) = h
	- if you have output, should be hard to figure out what input it had
H2) Second-preimage resistance
	- for any input m1, it should be difficult to find a different input m2 that gives same hash as another input
	- given m1 find an m2 with same hash
H3) Collision resistance
	- difficult to any pair of inputs such that H(m1) = H(m2)
	- just find same hash for m1 and m2, see if any 2 match

Random number generation
	- randomness (entropy)
	- random/unpredicatable numbers
pseudorandom number generator (PRNG)
	- start from some initial entropy (seed)
