Cryptography - collection of tools to help protect
- do not design your own cryptographic protocols or algorithms

Encryption and Decryption
- taking plain text and transforming it into something not readable

Cryptographic key
- bytes that is shared by encrypter and decrypter

Decryption key - recovery of plaintext

plaintext + key -> E -> ciphertext -> D -> key + text

Caesar cypher - shifting the alphabet

Exhaustive Key Search
- go through all keys k from the key space

DES Key Space
key length of 56 bits yields 2^56 possible keys

Cipher Attack Models
- In a ciphertext-only attack an adversary tries to recover plaintext (or key), given access to ciphertext alone

Known-plaintext Attack - given access to some ciphertext and its corresponding plaintext, adversary try to recover unknown plaintext or key from further ciphertext

Chosen-plaintext allows adversaries to choose some amount of plaintext and see the resulting ciphertext
- access to decryption dictionary

Chosen-ciphertext attack


2.2 
Symmetric Cryptography
key k and k' are same keys

Vernam cipher
- encrypts plaintext one bit at a time

message bits m_i
m = m_1 m_2 ...

shared keystream
k = k_1 k_2 ...

one bit for one key

take bits from cyphertext and bits from keystream and XOR = original message

XOR - has inverse property

  A| 	0 0 1 1
  B| 	0 1 0 1
XOR|	0 1 1 0

Pros - if keystream is sequence of truly random, independent bits that is never reused, then this is an unbreakable one-time pad
Cons - the key could get really large

One-time pad has no integrity
- 

Keys should only be used to encrypt one plaintext msg

AES Interface (block cipher)
- plaintext gets broken up into blocks
