3.3 Account recovery and secret questions

Recovery passwords and recovery links
- recovery email address, temp password, web page link that serves as authenticator
- enter temp code on following link and create new password

Loss of primary email password
- secondary email address, phone number (text msg)

Question-based recovery
- secret questions/challenge questions
- user selectable questions

Usabilty aspects
- information in user's long-term memory easier than remembering text passwords
1. recovery may be long removed
2. answers can change over time (ex. fav movie)
3. some users enters false answers and forgets

Security aspects
- answers may be weak (ex. baseball team, spouse's first name)
- not secret or too easily guessed

Summary
- poor in security and reliability
- stored in plaintext to allow case-insensitive
- don't use

3.4 One-time password generators and hardware tokens

one-time passwords (OTPs) - one use only
lists of passwords, one-way hash to generate OTPs

OTPs received by mobile
- text/SMS, server-side generated and sent

SIM swap attack
- tricks mobile phone provider into transferring victum's mobile number to new SIM

OTPs from lamport hash chains
- start with random secret (seed) w, user A authenticate to server B using sequnce of one-time passwords
H is one-way hash function, t is an integer, let hash chain of order t be the sequence: w, H(w), H(H(w), ... H^t
a hash chain is generated by applying consecutive cryptographic hash functions to a random number (seed), and then the hash values of the hash chain are used in reverse order as OTPs (we call this a “backward hash chain”)

Passcode generators
- timed OTP

Hardware tokens
- usb keys, chip-cards (smart cards)

User authentication categories
- Knowledge-based (what you know), passwords, pins, passpharses
- (what you have) , computer or hardware token
- (what you are) , biometrics
- (where you are) , location

Multiple factors
- 2FA , requires 2 
- Multi-factor authenication

Authentication
- user to device
- device to web
called "two-stage authentication"

Complementary factors and properties
- using 2 "what you know", memory burden
- hardware needs to be carried

Signals vs factors
Invisible/silent authentication
- IP-address
- cookies
- device fingerprinting

Factors, primary authentication and recovery
- unsuitable for primary authentication

3.5 Biometric authentication and MFA (video
- you don't have to carry anything or remember anything
- only one biometric and unique
- needs sensors
- analog, not always matched
- clean/dirty, aged
- not always 100%
- failure to enroll, born without finger? lost it?
- failure to capture, not the same as what it was

disadvantages
- if someone steals fingerprint can't change 
- only one fingerprint
- needs to be supervised to ensure

False rejects and false accepts
- fuzzy match for fingerprints or face id

Graph for matching biometric authentication (IMPORTANT)
- how good of a match to allow access?
- threshold (t) to make sure intruder doesn't get in and legit user can get in
- high threshold = legit user hard to get in
- low threshold = intruder/anyone can get in
