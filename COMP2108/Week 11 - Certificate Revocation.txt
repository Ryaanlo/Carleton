Certificate revocation
- certificates have expiration date but can be revoked ahead of time

Revocation reason
- subject's private key compromised
- key is superseded prior to expiry
- changed job titles

Methods for revoking certificates
Method 1: Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)
- periodically check list for certificates verifications
- lists can get really long

Method 2: CRL Fragments - Partitions and Deltas
- split up lists into different partitions
- instead of sending full lists you can send deltas with the changes

Method 3: Online status checking
online certificate status protocol (OCSP) 
- can consult 3rd party server to confirm validity of certificates
- privacy issues
- can get overwhelmed with requests

Method 4: Short-lived certificates
- 1-4 days short valid certificates

Method 5: Serving trusted public keys directly
- server send public key
- only works with closed systems
