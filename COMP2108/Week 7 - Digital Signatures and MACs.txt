Digital Signatures
- public-key algorithm
- tags are bitstrings

Signature Properties
1. Data origin authentication: whoever created the signature is the creator of the file
2. Data integrity: hash or fingerprint of file to make sure content is not tampered
3. Non-repudiation: difficult to create digital signatures and say it wasn't you, keys can get lost or stolen so property isn't as strong

Public-key signatures
- msg goes into signing algorithm with private signing key
- tag comes out
- msg + tag is sent
- msg and tag is then verified using public verification key
- valid or invalid msg + tag comes out

Public-key encryption
- take msg and encrypt with key only for the recipient, decryption with private key 

Message Authentication Codes (MAC)
- assuring integrity of data

shared key + message goes into MAC algorithm -> outputs a tag
message + tag is sent to recipient
shared key + message into MAC algorithm
if tag is the same and the recieved tag then it is valid
