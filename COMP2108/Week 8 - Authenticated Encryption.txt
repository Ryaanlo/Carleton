2.7 Authenticated encryption and further modes of operation

Encryption with gauranteed integrity

Authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD)
- msg data is encrypted
- with data that should be authenticated
- leave with header info (intermediate networking nodes)

Figure 2.13
- data to be encrypted + data to authenticated (not encrypted) + nonce (IV) + header packet
- goes into AEAD encrypt-generate + shared symmetric key
- everything is the same except plaintext is encrypted + MAC tag
- goes into AEAD decrypt-verify + key
- tag fails or tag verifies

CCM Mode of operation (Counter mode with CBC-MAC)
combines CTR mode of operation for encryption, stream cipher with CBC-MAC for authentication

Authentication Protocols
Entity authentication and key establishment
Protocol - exchange of messages between parties
Entity Authentication - process to verify identity of communicating party
Crytographic protocol - protocol that involves cryptograhic techniques
Authentication protocol - cryptographic protocol that provides entity authentication, authenticated key establishment or both
Figure 4.1 - Basic unilateral authentication
Shared secret: W
Generation number, encrypt with shared key then send it back and verify if they have correct shared key
TLS (correct website)

Session Keys - shared secret used for short-term perposes, communication or a call

Key transport - one party chooses symmetric key and transfer to another
Key agreement - shared key that is generated by both parties (half keys?)

Figure 4.3 - Key transport

Key distribution center (KDC)
- alice asks server to create keys
- server creates key and gives to both alice who gives it to bob
- short-term communication

Key translation center (KTC)
- client generates key and sends to server to encrypt
- alice sends encrypted key to bob 
- only bob can decrypt the key
