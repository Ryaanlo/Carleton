Modes of operation - what to do with extra blocks of encryption

ECB Mode (Electronic Code Book)
- take block of msg with key k
- encrypt block
- use key k to decrypt block

Issues: letter correspond to bit, not very strong

CBC Mode (cipher-block chaining)
- msg block is XOR'd with initialization vector (random set of bits)
- take the cipher text and XOR with next set of msg block
- decrypt from the end of the message

Counter (CTR) Mode
- msg block is XOR'd with a number (initialization value) that is being encrypted with the key k
- to decrypt -> init value encrypt with k and XOR with ciphertext

What modes of operation to use?
know length of plaintext? block 
dynamic length? keystream

Authenticated Encryption - protect info, integrity verify

Dangers of AES-CBC
- Bit flipping attacks
if we switch one bit from the previous block of ciphertext, 
it will be switched in the next deciphered block too
