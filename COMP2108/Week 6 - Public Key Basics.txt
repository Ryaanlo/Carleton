Public-key encryption and decryption

- two different keys 
- encryption public key
- decryption private key
- encrypting with a key specific to the recipient

keys e & d are related

Integrity of public key - needs to be correct, did it get modified?
	- everyone should be agreeing that the public key is good

Symmetric encryption - every key pair should be different n^2 keys
Public key encryption - each party only needs one set of keys

public key encryption really slow compared to symmetric encryption

Hybrid encryption 
- Start with plaintext
- Generate random encryption key
- Encrypt symmetric key with public key
- Encrypt msg with symmetric key -> encrypted payload
- Concat payload and encrypted symmetric key

RSA and integer factorization
RSA uses two prime numbers to encrypt and decrypt message
integer factorization - decomposition of positive int into a product of ints
