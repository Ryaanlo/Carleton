Diffie Hellman Key Agreement
- 2 parties with no prior contact to establish a shared secret by exchanging numbers over a readable channel
- both parties agree on prime number key p
- generator g for multiplicative group of integers modulo p
A selects private b
B selects private a

take generator and raises to a g^a
take generator and raises to b g^b

A -> g^a B
A g^b <- B

compute K = (g^a)^b mod p
compute K = (g^b)^a mod p

If attacker tries to intercept y = g^a & g^b
knows y and g but doesn't know a & b
they need to know what a and b is

g^? = y mod p

discrete logarithm problem
- can take very long time to solve

Postprocessing by KDF
- K is used as input to key derivation function(KDF) to create session key

ElGamal Encryption
- key transport
- one party provides key a

computes g^a mod p

Example
B provides key b
computes g^b mod p
B sends g^b to A

A picks key m
d = m*(g^b)^k mod p
y = g^k mod p
A sends d, y to B

B computes
t = y^-b = (g^k)^-b = g^-bk mod p
m = d*t mod p
m = m*(g^b)^k * g^-bk
m = m*g^bk * g^-bk

KDF(m) = session key
