What does a "why" query tell us?
Why a query was asked
What does a "how" query tell us?
How we know a premise is true
Consider a fuzzy set A in a universe U. What is the sum over all elements u in our universe of mA(u)?
Not enough information given.

Fuzzy Logic
Standard Logic, given a statement S
	S is true or S is false

Fuzzy Truth
The fuzzy truth value of a statement S, T(S), is a real value on the range [0,1]

Example: Consider the statements:
	A: 3 is about 4
	B: 4 is about 4
	C: 12 is about 4
	D: 1 is about 4

T(A) = 0.7
T(B) = 1
T(C) = 0
T(D) = 0.1

NOT (negation)
Negation n(x) is a function from the range [0,1] -> [0,1] that satisfies n(x) = 1-x "~"
T(~A) 	= n(T(A))
	= 1 - T(A)

AND (t-norm)
A t-norm t(x,y) is a function from [0,1]*[0,1] -> [0,1] that satisfies:
1. t(x,1) = x (identity)
2. t(x,y) = t(y,x) (commutativity)
3. t(x, t(y,z)) = t(t(x,y),z) (associativity)
4. If x <= w and y <= z then t(x,y) <= t(w,z) (monotonicity)

OR (s-norm)
An s-norm s(x,y) is a function from [0,1]*[0,1] -> [0,1] that satisfies:
1. s(x, 0) = x
2. s(x,y) = s(y,x)
3. s(x, s(y,z)) = s(s(x,y), z)
4. If x <= w and y <= z then s(x,y) <= s(w,z)

Godel t-norm and s-norm
t(x,y) = min(x,y)
s(x,y) = max(x,y)

Goguen t-norm and s-norm
t(x,y) = x*y
s(x,y) = x+y - x*y

Example: Consider the statements:
	A: 3 is about 4
	B: 4 is about 4
	C: 12 is about 4
	D: 1 is about 4

T(A) = 0.7
T(B) = 1
T(C) = 0
T(D) = 0.1

A and D using godel, goguen:
T(A and D) = 0.1
T(A and D) = 0.07

A or D using godel, goguen:
T(A or D) = 0.7
T(A or D) = 0.73

Operations on Fuzzy Sets
Complement
Given a universe U and a fuzzy set A, the fuzzy set ~A or U\A has membership function: 
	m_{U\A}(x) = n(m_A(x))

Intersection:
Given a universe U and fuzzy sets A, B, the membership function for their intersection A n B is:
	m_{A n B}(x) = t(m_A(x), m_B(x))

Union:
Given a universe U and fuzzy sets A,B, the membership function for their union A u B is:
	m{A u B}(x) = s(m_A(x), m_B(x))

Example
Two fuzzy sets A,B with triangle membership functions
A: a = 0, b = 2, c = 4
B: a = 2, b = 8, c = 10

What is ~A, A n B, A u B?
Use Godel t-norm, s-norm

Fuzzy IF-THEN Rules
IF 	... 		THEN 	...
	antecedent		consequence
1. Compute truth value of each proposition
2. Compute truth value of antecedent (rule strength)
3. Compute the output membership function by clipping the consequence membership function by the rule strength

Example: If patient is coughing AND patient is sneezing THEN diagnosis is cold.
	T(patient is coughing) = 0.7
	T(patient is sneezing) = 0.6
	Use godel t-norm
	Rule strength is 0.6
	m_consequence(x) = {	1 if x is cold
				0 otherwise	}
	m_output(x) = {	0.6 if x is cold
			0 otherwise	}

Fuzzy Rule-Based System
1. Compute the fuzzy truth value of all propositions
2. Compute the rule strength for all rules
3. Compute output membership function for each rule
4. Compute the combined membership function by taking the union over all outupt membership functions
5. Defuzzify by taking the argmax

Example: IF patient coughing lots AND patient sneezing lots THEN diagnosis is cold
	IF patient coughing little AND patient sneezing lots then diagnosis is allergies

Patient with 4 cough/min, 4 sneeze/min
What is diagnosis? Godel t-, s-norm

1. 	T(coughing lots) = 0.1
	T(sneezing lots) = 0.9
	T(coughing little) = 0.8
2.	1 Rule strength = 0.1
	2 Rule strength = 0.8
3.	m_1(x) = {	0.1 x is cold
			0 otherwise	}
	m_2(x) = {	0.8 x is allergies
			0 otherwise 	}
4. 	m_combined(x) =	{0.1 x is cold
			0.8 x is allergies
			0 otherwise	}
5. Max is Allergies
