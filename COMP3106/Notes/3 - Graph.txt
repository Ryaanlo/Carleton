What does it mean for a task environment to be episodic?
The current action does not affect future actions

What is the difference between a simple reflex agent and a model-based reflex agent?
Simple Reflex Agent
- Take actions based on only current percept
Model-Based Reflex Agent
- Agent that maintains some internal model of the environment state

What is the difference between a goal-based agent and utility-based agent?
Goal-Based Agent
- Reach some state, goal state
Utility-Based Agent
- maximize happiness?

Goal-Based Agents
- Agents that act to achieve some desirable goal state
- Flexible with respect to the goal state
- Go from point A to B

Utility-Based Agents
- Agents that act to maximize some utility functions
- Learn to walk

What are the differences between goal-based and utility-based agents?
1. Utility function provides a continuous quantity to maximize
2. Utility function allows multiple goals to be considered with some tradeoff
3. Utility functions allows probabilities of achieving hoal states from a set of goals to be maximized

Examples: Robot Vaccuum
Simple-Reflex: 
	If dirt in current square then clean
	If no dirt in current square then move

Model-Based: 
	Record which squares it cleans most
	Best path between each set of squares
	Keep track of tiles most recently cleaned
	Closest dirty square
	
	If dirt in dirty square then 
	navigate to most likely dirty square
	record the current state

Goal-Based:
	Goal: All squares are clean

Utility-Based:
	Consider tradeoff between time taken and how many squares are clean

Example: Robotic medical tutor for training surgeons using a plastic model
Simple-Reflex
	If trainee's action was correct then :check_mark:
	If trainee's action was incorrect then :incorrect:

Model-Based:
	Current state of the patient
	The sequence of steps completed
	The correct workflow of steps
	Time elapsed

Goal-Based:
	Goal: Surgery completed successfully

Utility-Based:
	What steps have been completed successfully
	Patient stability
	How long is the recovery
	Time taken

Graph Theory
A set of vertices/nodes V
A set of edges connecting the vertices E
Path is a sequence of nodes connecting two vertices using successive edges

Example: 
Node: A,B,C,D,E,F
Edges: (A,C), (A,D), 

Path from C to B
C, A, F, B
C, D, E ,B

Path from C to A
C, A
C, D, A

Graphs Representation of Problems
Let nodes in our graph represent environment states
S - set of start states		S <= V, S != Empty Set
G - set of goal states 		G <= V, G != Empty Set
Let edges in or graph represent actions E

A solution to our problem is a path from s in S to a g in G

Task Environment
Fully observable (knows current state), single agent, deterministic, sequential, static, discrete, known
