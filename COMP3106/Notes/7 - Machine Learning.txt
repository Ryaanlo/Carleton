Types of Machine Learning
- Improving performance of a system on future tasks based on observations/data about the population

3 Types of Machine Learning:
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Reinforced learning

Supervised Learning
Data: Pairs (x,y)
	- x is input
	- y is label

Objective: Learn a function f, such that f(x) = y

Tasks: Classification, Regression, Image Segmentation

Unsupervised Learning
Data: x
	- x is input

Objective: Learn structure of data

Tasks: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, Density Estimation

Reinforced Learning
Data: s, r
	- s is environment state
	- r is reward

Objective: Learn actions maximizing reward

Tasks: Sequential Decision Making, Search/Planning, Control Systems

Machine Learning Methods
SUPERVISED LEARNING
• Analogy-based methods
	• Nearest neighbour
	• Support vector machine
• Inductive methods
	• Rule-based systems (will discuss later)
	• Decision trees
• Connective methods
	• Neural networks (will discuss later)
• Evolutionary methods
	• Genetic algorithm (will discuss later)
• Bayesian methods
	• Bayesian inference (will discuss later)

UNSUPERVISED LEARNING
• Clustering methods
	• Hierarchical clustering
	• K-means clustering
• Dimensionality Reduction methods
	• Principal components analysis
• Density estimation
	• Kernel density estimation

Nearest Neighbour
	- classification or regression

Support Vector Machine
	- boundary line that separate points
	- classification
	- ex. good day to rent a bike? input: weather

Decision Tree
	- Splits into 2

Hierarchical Clustering
	- Unsupervised
	- Looks at similarity of inputs

K-means Clustering
	- Unsupervised
	- Centroid

Principal Components Analysis
	- Dimensionality Reduction

Kernel Density Estimation
	- Density Estimation

• Imagine our classifier predicts 𝑃 (𝐶 = 1)
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1
𝑃 (𝐶 = 1)
