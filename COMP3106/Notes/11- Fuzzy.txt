What are the components of an expert system?
User interface, knowledge base, inference engine

What is the difference between goal-based reasoning and data-driven reasoning?
Goal-based: Start with the goal and work towards the goal, 
Data-driven: Starting with whatever we know and then try to find out things about the system

Data-Driven Reasoning
Seeks to find out all possible information about a system starting from the evidence we have

1. For every rule R
	i. Check if the propositions in antecedent are askable or known
	ii. If all proposition in antecedent are askable or known, then query the user about the askable propositions
	iii. Add the values to working memory
	iv. Check if antecedent is true, if true then add consequence to working memory

Iterate until no new rules "fire" (are true)

Example: Medical Diagnosis System
IF coughing* and sneezing* THEN diagnosis is cold
IF vomiting* and fever% THEN diagnosis is flu
IF mouth temp high* and ear temp high* THEN fever

* = askable

Working memory: 
	Coughing true
	Sneezing false

	rule 2: vomiting askable but fever not askable

	rule 3:
	mouth temp high true
	ear temp high true
	fever true

	vomiting true

	diagnosis flu

1. Goal-driven reasoning achieves goal faster
2. Don't evaluate the truth values of antecedents if we don't know all propositions

Explanation in Rule-Based Systems
How: how the system reached a conclusion
Why: Why did the system query the user for the value of a proposition

Keep track of which rule or query led to which conclusion

How explanations:
	If conclusion was queried from user:
		print("queried from user")
	else:
		print("follows from " + rule)

Keep track of which rule was under consideration when a query was asked.

Why explanations:
	print("this is needed to determine value of " + rule.antecedent + "in" + rule)

Fuzzy Sets
Standard set theory: Given a set A, and an element x, either x belongs to A or x !belongs to A

Fuzzy Set
Given a universe of discourse U, a fuzzy set is a function m:U -> [0,1]
We call m the "membership function"
We call m(x) the degree of membership
Fuzzy set: A, Membership: m_A(x)

Example: Consider the fuzzy set defined as "about 4" in the universe of integers
	0 if x<1 or x>7
	0.1 if x=1 or x=7
m(x)={	0.4 if x=2 or x=6	}
	0.7 if x=3 or x=5
	1 if x=4

Membership Functions on the Reals
Triangle: 

	0 if x<=a
	x-a/b-a if a<=x<=b
m(x)={	c-x/c-b if b<=x<=c	}
	0 if x>=c

Trapezoidal:

	0 if x<=a
	x-a/b-a if a<=x<=b
m(x)={	1 if b<=x<=c	}
	d-x/d-c if c<=x<=d
	0 if x>=d

Flat (Hat):

	0 if x<a
m(x)={	1 if a<=x<=b	}
	0 if x>b

Gaussian:

m(x) = e^[-1/2 (x-mu/sigma)^2]
