1. Implementation detail
2. Everytime we add a node for frontier, keep track of where we came from "Parent" attribute
3. Important. Affects search behaviour
	Queue
	Priority Queue
	Stack

Breadth first search
Frontier is FIFO queue

Complexity:
Imagine graph is a tree with arity b

Imagine out solution is at depth d

Time complexity: O(b^d)

Space complexity: O(b^d)

Depth First Search
Frontier is a LIFO stack

Complexity:
Imagine our graph is a tree with arity b and our solution is at depth d,
with maximum depth m?

Time complexity: O(b^m)

Space complexity: O(mb)

Advanced Graph (Best First) Search
How do we assign priority?
Consideration: The length of the path from the start state to the current statess

Uniform Cost Search
Frontier is a priority queue
