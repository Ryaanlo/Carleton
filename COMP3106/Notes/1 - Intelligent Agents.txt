Intelligent Agents

Agent
- An entity that perceives its environment using sensors and acts on its environment using actuators

Percepts - inputs to agent
Actions - outputs from agent

Ex. Human agent
Sensors: Eyes, Nose, Ears
Actuators: Arms, Legs, Hands, Mouth, Joints

Ex. Smartphone agent
Sensors: Keys, Microphone, Camera, Pen
Actuator: Flashlight, Screen, Vibration, Speakers

How do we map percepts to actions?
Agent function - describes mapping of percepts to actions
Agent program - implementation of the agent function

Ex. Robot Vacuum

Sensors: LIDAR, Camera, Odometer, Bumper, Battery Sensor
Actuators: Wheels, Vacuum suction
Percepts: Dust in current square, obstacles, battery capacity
Actions: Forward, Backwards, Left, Right, Clean

What does an agent function look like?
Percept
- no dust in square
- obstacles on left
- dust in square
- obstacle left, right
------------
Action
- move left

- clean

What about sequences of percepts?
Percept Sequence
[B,clean], [A,clean]
---------
Action
- move down

Rational Agent
- An agent is rational if for all percept sequences it selects the action that is expected to maximize a performance measure given the percept sequence and built-in knowledge it has.

Performance Measure
- A way of evaluating the desirability of a sequence of environment states.

For Robot Vacuum Example
Performance Measure: # of squares that have dirt
		     time to clean room

An agent is called autonomous if its behaviour changes based on what it perceives

Task Environment - fully characterized if we can define the 4 things below
(P)erformance Measure
(E)nvironment
(A)ctuators
(S)ensors
