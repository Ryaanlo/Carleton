Compile and Running:
gcc -o fishingSimulator fishingSimulator.c
./fishingSimulator
gcc -o dynamicVersion dynamicVersion.c
./dynamicVersion

Instructions:
When testing, please include:
srand(time(NULL));
in the main function to allow for random to be randomized

I've also included the test case that was in the assignment specification if you would like to use that. If not, you can remove it from the main function.
