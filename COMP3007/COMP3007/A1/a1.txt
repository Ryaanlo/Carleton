λx. (λy. xz(λx. xy)) (w (λs. syx))

Q2)

a) Suppose S and T are the sets of free variables of terms M and N, respectively. What is the set of free variables of the term MN?

If S and T are the sets of free variables of terms M and N then the set of free variables of the term MN are S and T.

b) Suppose S is the set of free variables of M. What is the set of variables of λx.M?

If S is the set of free variables of M then the set of variables of λx.M are S.

c) Give an example of a term with no free variables.

λx.x

d) Give an example of a term with one free variable that becomes a term with no free variables after one step of reduction.

(λy.xy)x

e) Give an example of a term with one free variable where the number of free variable occurrences doubles after one step of reduction. (Note: λx.xyy has one free variable, y, but two occurrences of it.)

   (λx.xx)(λx.xy)
   (λx.xy)(λx.xy)
   (λx.xy)y
   yy

Q3)

a) Show a sequence of one-step reductions that normalizes the following term.
   (λfgx.fx(gx))(λxy.x)(λxy.x)
   (λgx.(λxy.x)x(gx))(λxy.x)
   (λgx.(λy.x)(gx))(λxy.x)
   (λx.(λy.x)((λxy.x)x))
   (λx.(λy.x)(λy.x))
   λx.x

b) Describe what happens if we try to normalize the term
   ( λf. (λx. f(xx)) (λx.f(xx)) )  (λx.x)
   (λx. ((λx.x)(xx))) (λx.((λx.x)(xx))) 
   (λx.(xx) (λx.(xx))
   (λx.(xx) (λx.(xx))

   The same step of reduction repeats forever.

c) Give an example of a term that is normalizing (some sequence of one-step reductions take it to a normal form) but where it is possible to repeat one-step reductions forever.

   (λx.xx)(λx.xx)
   (xx)[(λx.xx)/x]
   (λx.xx)(λx.xx)
