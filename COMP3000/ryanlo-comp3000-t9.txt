Part A
3. put_user is only used for copying a single variable while copy_to_user and copy_from_user is used for copying many things. Maybe accessing username addresses directly is not as accurate?

4. ioctl takes in a request code and performs that request on the fd. It passes in a file descriptor and the case for allocating kernel memory for the struct for memview. For physicalmemview it registers it in a struct. 

Part B
2. They both report the physical memory report view while the memview2 reports the virtual memview.

3. The pattern in the virtual mem address is that it increases with a fixed value of 1010 everytime. Physical mem address does not have this same pattern, probably because in physcial memory they allocate blocks randomly depending on if there is space.

4. 
a) both virtual and physical addresses seems to change every run.

b) main, puts, lmsg, gmsg all seem to stay the same after every run, maybe because local variables are always stored the same


Part C
1. They all seems to be allocated in around the same area in virtual space compared to userspace.

2. Page allocation does seem to differ from slab allocation, there seems to be a gap between each slab allocation before it starts a new one.
