Upon launching, the program will ask you to Login or Create an account.
Creating an Account will always cause the user to not be an Owner.
Logging in with an Owner Account (ex. Username: "Daniel", Password: "Lawrence") will allow you to order more books and Generate Reports.
Logging in as a non-owner (ex. Username: Issac, password: password) will allow you to browse books, link an address, or logout.
Owners may also access these options.
