\section{Non-Local Strings}

\begin{enumerate}
   \item What is the number of dec-strings of length n?
  
   by the Product Rule, the number of blocks is
   \[
      10^{n}
   \]

   \item What is the number of dec-strings $d_1,\ldots,d_n$ of length n such that $d1d2\neq00$. In other words, what is the number of dec-strings of length n that don't begin with 00?
 
   Therefore, by the Product Rule, then number of squarefree blocks is 
   \[
      (10^{2}-1) \times 10^{n-2}
   \]
   \[
      10^{n} - 10^{n-2}
   \]
  
   \item What is the number of dec-strings $d_1,\ldots,d_n$ of length n such that $d_1d_2\neq00$ and $d_2d_3\neq11$?
  
   Therefore, by the Product Rule, then number of non-local blocks is 
   \[
      10^{n} - 10^{n-2} - 10^{n-2}
   \]
   \[
      (10^3 - (2 \times 10)) \times 10^{n-3}
   \]  
   \item What is the number of dec-strings $d_1,\ldots,d_n$ of length $n$ such that $d_1d_2\neq00$ and $d_2d_3\neq01$?
   
   \[
      10^{n} - 10^{n-2} - 10^{n-2} - 2
   \]

   \item What is the number of dec-strings $d_1,\ldots,d_n$ of lenght $n$ such that $d_1d_2\neq00$ or $d_1d_2d_3=111$?
   
   \item What is the number of dec-strings $d_1,\ldots,d_n$ of length $n\geq4$ such that $d_1d_2\neq00$ or $d_3d_4\neq11$.
   
   \item A dec-string $d_1,\ldots,d_n$ is $bad$ if $d_i=d_i+1$ or $d_i+d_i+1=9$ for at least one $i\in\{1,\ldots,n-1\}$ and it is good otherwise. What is the number of good dec-strings of length $n$?
   
   \item A dec-string $d_1,\ldots,d_n$ is $2-bad$ if, $d_i=d_j$ or $d_i+d_j=9$ for some $i<j \leq i+2$ and it is $2-good$ otherwise. What is the number of $2-good$ dec-strings?
   
   \item A dec-string $d_1,\ldots,d_n$ is $k-bad$ if $d_i=d_j$ or $di+dj=9$ for some $i<j \leq i+k$ and is $k-good$ otherwise. What is the number of $k-good$ dec-strings of length $n$?

  \item By now the pattern should become clear.  
  
  For a $k$-non-local block $s_0,s_1,\ldots,s_{19}$ we have $26-i$ choices for $s_i$ for each $i\in\{0,\ldots,k-1\}$ and we have $26-k$ choices for $s_i$ for each $i\in\{k,\ldots,19\}$.
  Therefore, by the Product Rule, then number of $k$-non-local blocks is 
  \[
     \left(\prod_{i=0}^{k-1}(26-i)\right)\times (26-k)^{20-k} =
     \left(26\times 25\times\cdots\times (26-k+1)\right)\times(26-k)^{20-k}
     \enspace
  \]
\end{enumerate}

\section{Collective Arts}

Collective Arts Brewing currently makes 30 types of IPA and 6 types of Lager.

\begin{enumerate}

   \item The manager at Mike's Place needs to choose 4 types of IPA and 4 types of Lager. How many options does the manager have?

   \[
     30\times 29\times 28\times 27\times 
     6\times 5\times 4\times 3
   \]
   

\end{enumerate}
