\section{Non-Local Strings}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What is the number of dec-strings of length n?
  
  by the Product Rule, the number of blocks is
  \[
      10^{n}
  \]

  \item What is the number of dec-strings $d_1,\ldots,d_n$ of length n such that $d1d2\neq00$. In other words, what is the number of dec-strings of length n that don't begin with 00?
 
  Therefore, by the Product Rule, then number of squarefree blocks is 
  \[
      10^{n} - 10^{n-2} when n > 1
      when n = 0, 10
  \]
  
  \item What is the number of dec-strings $d_1,\ldots,d_n$ of length n such that $d_1d_2\neq00$ and $d_2d_3\neq11$?
  
  Therefore, by the Product Rule, then number of non-local blocks is 
  \[
     26\times 25\times 24^{18} = 4\,536\,445\,601\,729\,847\,895\,680\,614\,400
     \enspace .
  \]
  
   \item What is the number of dec-strings $d_1,\ldots,d_n$ of length $n$ such that $d_1d_2\neq00$ and $d_2d_3\neq01$?
   
   \item What is the number of dec-strings $d_1,\ldots,d_n$ of lenght $n$ such that $d_1d_2\neq00$ or $d_1d_2d_3=111$?
   
   \item What is the number of dec-strings $d_1,\ldots,d_n$ of length $n\geq4$ such that $d_1d_2\neq00$ or $d_3d_4\neq11$.
   
   \item A dec-string $d_1,\ldots,d_n$ is $bad$ if $d_i=d_i+1$ or $d_i+d_i+1=9$ for at least one $i\in\{1,\ldots,n-1\}$ and it is good otherwise. What is the number of good dec-strings of length $n$?
   
   \item A dec-string $d_1,\ldots,d_n$ is $2-bad$ if, $d_i=d_j$ or $d_i+d_j=9$ for some $i<j \leq i+2$ and it is $2-good$ otherwise. What is the number of $2-good$ dec-strings?
   
   \item A dec-string $d_1,\ldots,d_n$ is $k-bad$ if $d_i=d_j$ or $di+dj=9$ for some $i<j \leq i+k$ and is $k-good$ otherwise. What is the number of $k-good$ dec-strings of length $n$?

  \item By now the pattern should become clear.  
  
  For a $k$-non-local block $s_0,s_1,\ldots,s_{19}$ we have $26-i$ choices for $s_i$ for each $i\in\{0,\ldots,k-1\}$ and we have $26-k$ choices for $s_i$ for each $i\in\{k,\ldots,19\}$.
  Therefore, by the Product Rule, then number of $k$-non-local blocks is 
  \[
     \left(\prod_{i=0}^{k-1}(26-i)\right)\times (26-k)^{20-k} =
     \left(26\times 25\times\cdots\times (26-k+1)\right)\times(26-k)^{20-k}
     \enspace
  \]
