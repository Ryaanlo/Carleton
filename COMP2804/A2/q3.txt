I will give solution of Q3, please post other questions separately.

solution for Q3:

Each time the function "THIRD" goes into recursion, n is reduced to n by 3. Now we have n as power of 3,

so lets take n = 3k for some k belongs to natural numbers.

Then we have k = log3(n)

Here the base case will be n = 3.

When n = 3, total number times "PROCESS" is called = 3

When n = 32, total number times "PROCESS" is called = 32

When n = 33, total number times "PROCESS" is called = 33

......

......

When n = 3k, total number times "PROCESS" is called = 3k

So total number of times "PROCESS" is called is (31 + 32 + ... + 3k) = 3*(3k - 1) / (3-1) = (3/2) * (n-1)
