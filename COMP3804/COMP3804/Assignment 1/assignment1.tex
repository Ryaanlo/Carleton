\begin{question} 
Consider the following recurrence, where $n$ is a power of $6$: 
\[ T(n) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 
                    1 & \mbox{if $n=1$,} \\ 
                    n^2 + 11 \cdot T(n/6) & \mbox{if $n \geq 6$.} 
                  \end{array} 
          \right. 
\]

\begin{itemize} 
\item Solve this recurrence using the \emph{unfolding method}. 
Give the final answer using Big-O notation.  

$T(n) = n^2 + 11 * T(n/6)$

$T(n) = n^2 + 11 (({n/6})^2 + 11 *T(n/6^2))$

$T(n) = n^2 + 11({n/6})^2 + 11^2 * T(n/6^2)$

$T(n) = (1 + 11/6^2) n^2 + 11^2 * T(n/6^2)$

$T(n) = (1 + 11/6^2) n^2 + 11^2 * ((n/6^2)^2 + 11 * T(n/6^3))$

$T(n) = (1 + 11/6^2 + 11^2/6^4) n^2 + 11^3 * T(n/6^3)$

$T(n) = (1 + 11/6^2 + 11^2/6^4) n^2 + 11^3 * ((n/6^3)^2 + 11 * T(n/6^4))$

$T(n) = (1 + 11/6^2 + 11^2/6^4 + 11^3/6^6) n^2 + 11^4 * T(n/6^4)$

.
.
.

$T(n) = (1 + 11/6^2 + 11^2/6^4 + ... + 11^{k-1}/6^{2(k-1)}) n^2 + 11^k * T(n/6^{k})$

$T(n/6^{k}) = T(1)$

$T(n) \leq \sum_{i=0}^{k-1}11^i/6^{2i} n^2 + 6^k * T(1)$

$= \frac{(11/6^2)^k - 1}{(11/6^2) - 1}1/1-(11/6^2) n^2 + 6^k$

$= \frac{36}{25} n^2 + n$

$= O(n^2)$

\item Solve this recurrence using the \emph{Master Theorem}. 
\end{itemize} 

$a = 11, b = 6, d = 2$

if $d > log_b a : T(n) = O(n^d)$

$2 > log_6 11$

$2 > 1.3383$

$T(n) = O(n^2)$

\begin{question} 
Consider the following recurrence:  
\[ T(n) = n + T(n/5) + T(7n/10) . 
\]
In class, we have seen that $T(n) = O(n)$. In this question, you will 
prove this using the \emph{recursion tree method}. 

Recall from class: The root represents the recursion tree on an input 
of size $n$. Consider a node $u$ in the recursion tree that represents 
a recursive call on an input of size $m$. Then we write the value $m$ 
at this node $u$, we give $u$ a left subtree which is a recursion tree 
for an input of size $m/5$, and we give $u$ a right subtree which is a 
recursion tree for an input of size $7m/10$. In this way, $T(n)$ is the 
sum of the values stored at all nodes in the entire recursion tree. 

Below, we assume that the \emph{levels} in the recursion tree are 
numbered $0,1,2,\ldots,$, where the root is at level $0$. For each 
$i \geq 0$, let $S_i$ be the sum of the values of all nodes at level 
$i$. 
 
\begin{itemize}
\item Determine $S_0$. 
\item Determine $S_1$. 
\item Determine $S_2$. 
\item Use induction to prove the following claim: For every $i \geq 0$, 
\[ S_i \leq (9/10)^i \cdot n . 
\] 

\noindent \emph{Hint:} Consider level $i$, let $k = 2^i$, and let the 
values stored at the nodes at level $i$ be $m_1,m_2,\ldots,m_k$. 
What are the values stored at the nodes at level $i+1$? 
\item Complete the proof by showing that $T(n) = O(n)$. 
\end{itemize} 



$O(n)$

\end{question} 

\begin{solution}

      \includegraphics[width=150mm]{a1tree.png}

      The values stored at the nodes at level i + 1 are:

      $(1/5^i)n$, $(7/5^{i-1}*10)n$, $(7^{i-1}/5*10^{i-1})n$, $(7^i/5*10^i)n$

      $S_0 = n$

      $S_1 = (9/10)n$

      $S_2 = (9/10)^2 n$

      $S_3 = (9/10)^3 n$

      $n/5^k = 1$

      $k = log_5 n$

      $n/(7/10)^k = 1$

      $k_2 = log_{10/7} n$

      $T(n)= n + (9/10)n + (9/10)^2 n + ... + (9/10)^k n$

      $= n[1 + (9/10) + (9/10)^2 + ... + (9/10)^k]$

      $T(n) = O(n)$

\begin{question} 
Zoltan is not only your friendly TA, he is also the owner of the popular 
budget airline ZoltanJet that offers flights in Canada. As you all know, 
there are $n$ airports in Canada. We denote these airports, in order from 
west to east, by $A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_n$. 

William, who is the CEO of ZoltanJet, has designed a \emph{flight plan} 
which is a list of ordered pairs $(A_i,A_j)$ of airports such that there 
is a direct flight from $A_i$ to $A_j$. This flight plan has the 
following two properties: 
\begin{itemize}
\item (P.1) Every flight is going 
      eastwards\footnote{But how do I get home? A customer service 
      representative will tell you ``that is your problem''.}. 
      In other words, if $(A_i,A_j)$ is in the flight plan, then $i<j$. 
\item (P.2) For any two indices $i$ and $j$ with $1 \leq i < j \leq n$, 
      it is possible to fly from $A_i$ to $A_j$ in at most two 
      \emph{hops}. In other words, either $(A_i,A_j)$ is in the flight 
      plan, or there is an index $k$ such that both $(A_i,A_k)$ and 
      $(A_k,A_j)$ are in the flight plan. Note that, because of (P.1), 
      $i < k < j$. 
\end{itemize}
Observe that ZoltanJet can guarantee (P.1) and (P.2) by offering 
direct flights between all ${n \choose 2} = \Theta(n^2)$ pairs 
$(A_i,A_j)$ of airports, where $1 \leq i < j \leq n$. 

\begin{itemize}
\item  
\noindent
Prove that ZoltanJet can guarantee (P.1) and (P.2) using a flight plan 
having only $O(n \log n)$ pairs of airports. You may assume that $n$ is a 
power of two.  

\noindent \emph{Hint:} Since this is the divide-and-conquer assignment, 
you probably have to use $\ldots$
\end{itemize}

\begin{solution}
      
      From P.1 we can imagine it as a sorted array of airports. 
      Now we can take P.2 and since it is possible to fly between 
      $A_i$ to $A_j$ in at most two hops, we can randomly partition it into 3 parts.
      Where the flight starts in the first partition hops into the second partition,
      then hops towards the third partition. Dividing it into 3 parts gives us
      $log_3 n$ and the case of having to visit every airports $n$.
      
      We get n traversals over every airport and n/3 partitions everytime so $O(nlogn)$ 


\end{solution}

\begin{question}
Professor Justin Bieber needs a fast algorithm that searches for an 
arbitrary element $x$ in a sorted array $A[1 \ldots n]$ of $n$ numbers. 
He remembers that there is something called ``binary search'', 
which maintains an interval $[\ell,r]$ of indices such that, if 
$x$ is present in the array, then it is contained in the subarray 
$A[\ell \ldots r]$. In one iteration, the algorithm takes the 
middle index, say $p$, in the interval $[\ell,r]$. Then the 
algorithm either finds $x$ at the position $p$, or it recurses in 
the interval $[\ell,p-1]$, or it recurses in the interval 
$[p+1,r]$. Unfortunately, Professor Bieber does not remember the 
expression\footnote{is it 
$\lfloor (r - \ell)/2 \rfloor$, or 
$\lceil (r - \ell)/2 \rceil$, or 
$\lfloor (r - \ell +1)/2 \rfloor$, or 
$\lceil (r - \ell +1)/2 \rceil$? 
}
for $p$ in terms of $\ell$ and~$r$. 

Professor Bieber does remember that, instead of choosing $p$ in the 
middle of the interval $[\ell,r]$, it is often enough to choose $p$ 
uniformly at random in this interval. Based on this, he obtains the 
following algorithm: The input consists of the sorted array 
$A[1 \ldots n]$, its size $n$, and a number $x$. If $x$ is in the array, 
then the algorithm returns the index $p$ such that $A[p]=x$. Otherwise, 
the algorithm returns ``not present''. We assume that all numbers in 
$A$ are distinct.

Let $T$ be the running time of this algorithm on an input array of 
length $n$. Note that $T$ is a random variable. Prove that the expected 
value of $T$ is $O(\log n)$.

\noindent \emph{Hint:} Most solutions that you find on the internet 
are wrong. 
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
      
      A is a sorted array of n numbers. x is the element that we are searching for.

      We are going to show: $E(T) = O(log n)$

      When we run $BieberSearch(A,n,x)$, recursive calls are generated on smaller and smaller arrays.

      The expected time value of T considers all the cases where we get x.

      After 1 run, 2 runs, 3 runs, ..., n runs.

      Using the linearity of expectation we get:

      $T(n) = T(1) + T(2) + T(3) + ... + T(n)$

      $T(n) = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n-1$

      This is actually a case of the harmonic numbers. The sum of the reciprocals becomes log n.

      $T(n) = O(logn)$

\end{solution}


\begin{question}
You are given a sequence $S$ consisting of $n$ numbers; not all of these 
numbers need to be distinct. 

Describe an algorithm, in plain English, that decides, in $O(n)$ time, 
whether or not this sequence $S$ contains a number that occurs more 
than $n/4$ times. 

You may use any result that was proven in class. Justify the correctness
of your algorithm and explain why the running time is $O(n)$. 

\noindent \emph{Hint:} The algorithm must be comparison-based; you are
not allowed to use hashing, bucket-sort, or radix-sort. 
\end{question}

\begin{solution}
    We can start with finding the median using the selection algorithm that we learned in class.
    We first find the median(m) then create a 3-way partition based on that median. Where we have the first partition as
    $|<m|, |=m|, |>m|$.
    If the median(m) is the element that we are looking for then we are finished looking.
    Otherwise, we can call this algorithm on both sides of the partition $|<m|, |>m|$.
    Once we find the element we can count if the equal partition contains more than $n/4$ of that element.
    If we find the element as the median then it is finished otherwise the element does not exist where it occurs more than $n/4$ times
    because dividing it into another 3-way partition will not have enough elements for $n/4$.
    Finding out the median takes $O(n)$ time, running the algorithm again on the right and left sides takes $2 * O(n)$ time.
    In total it takes $3*O(n)$ which is just $O(n)$.
    
\end{solution}
